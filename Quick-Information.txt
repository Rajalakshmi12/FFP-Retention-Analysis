1. Using LSOA codes, we can get geographic boundaries or centroid coordinates

For the UK:
LSOA (Lower-layer Super Output Area) codes are tied to shapefiles from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Each LSOA has a defined polygon boundary (GeoJSON/Shapefile).
You can extract the centroid (lat/lon) and join it to your dataset.
